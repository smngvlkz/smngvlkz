👀 I'm passionate about everything tech and gaming.

🌱 I'm currently learning Fullstack Software Engineering with ALX Africa that partnered with the Mastercard Foundation and The ROOM.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that will change people's lives, especially those who lack the opportunities to start in Tech.
