I am a passionate software and research engineer, and an avid gamer. This portfolio is a testament to my journey in the realm of software development. It's a collection of projects that I've poured my heart into - from projects that I've created from scratch, contributed to, and used as stepping stones in my continuous learning process.

## 🎯 Objective

My goal is to leverage my skills and experience in software engineering and research to drive innovation, explore new technologies, and solve complex problems. I aim to demonstrate my expertise in developing cutting-edge solutions, conducting thorough research, and collaborating with others to push the boundaries of what's possible.
