## About Me:
Iâ€™m a self-taught software engineer from South Africa.<br><br>This is my personal portfolio of software engineering projects that I have created or contributed to. I have used various technologies, such as Typescript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, MongoDB, Python, Django, Selenium, and more. My goal is to showcase my skills and experience as a software engineer and to learn new things along the way.

Here are some of the repositories and projects that Iâ€™m proud of:

â€¢ CMS Dashboard: A web application that allows users to create, manage, and publish content for their online stores. It uses Next.js, Typescript, React, Tailwind, Prisma, and MySQL.

â€¢ alx-low_level_programming: A collection of low-level programming exercises and projects in C. It covers topics such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and system calls.

â€¢ Desktop-Automation-App: A Python script that automates my desktop. It monitors my download folder and allocates each file according to their format automatically.

â€¢ Discord-clone-app: A Discord Clone App using Nextjs, Typescript, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind and MySQL. It allows users to create and join chat rooms, send and receive messages, and use voice and video calls.

â€¢ Ecommerce-store: An e-commerce store built using Nextjs, Typescript, React, and TailwindCSS. It allows users to browse, search, and buy products, as well as view their orders and profile. The backend is handled by the CMS Dashboard that I built.

â€¢ Azande: A voice assistant named Azande that uses OpenAI ChatGPT-3 as an engine. It can answer questions, and have conversations with the user.
