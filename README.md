- 👋 Hi, I’m a South African software engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything tech and gaming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack Software Engineering with ALX Africa that was founded by Julien Barbier who is also a co-founder of Holberton School.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will change the lives of people mostly those who lack the opportunities to start in Tech
