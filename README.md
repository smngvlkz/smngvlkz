## About Me:
Iâ€™m a self-taught software engineer from South Africa.<br><br>This is my personal portfolio of software engineering projects that I have created or contributed to. I have used various technologies, such as Typescript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, MongoDB, Python, Django, Selenium, and more.
